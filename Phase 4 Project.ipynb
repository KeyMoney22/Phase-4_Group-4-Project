    "# Developing a Deep Learning Model for Predicting Agricultural Weather Conditions and Crop Water Requirements in Hyderabad - India Using Time Series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "India, a country that occupies the greater part of South Asia, consists of 28 states and eight union territories, with its national capital in New Delhi. The government is a constitutional republic that represents a highly diverse population, including thousands of ethnic groups and hundreds of languages. As of 2023, India became the world’s most populous country, according to United Nations estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Archaeological evidence shows that a highly sophisticated urbanized culture—the Indus civilization—dominated the northwestern part of the subcontinent from about 2600 to 2000 BCE. India has been a self-contained political and cultural arena, giving rise to a distinctive tradition primarily associated with Hinduism. Other religions like Buddhism and Jainism also originated here, contributing to India's rich intellectual life in fields such as mathematics, astronomy, architecture, literature, music, and the fine arts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout its history, India experienced incursions from beyond its northern mountain wall, significantly impacting its culture. Islam, introduced by Arab, Turkish, Persian, and other raiders from the northwest beginning early in the 8th century CE, eventually led to Muslim rule over much of the subcontinent by the 13th century. The arrival of Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498 and the establishment of European maritime supremacy heralded major external influences, culminating in British rule. British administration began in 1858, unifying the subcontinent politically and economically. India gained independence in 1947, partitioned into India and Pakistan along religious lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "India remains one of the world’s most ethnically diverse countries. Apart from its many religions and sects, India is home to innumerable castes and tribes and more than a dozen major linguistic groups. Efforts to instill a spirit of nationhood have been made, though tensions and violence between neighboring groups have occurred. Despite challenges, India has shown physical prosperity and cultural dynamism, evident in its infrastructure, diversified industrial base, scientific and engineering personnel, and cultural exports in music, literature, and cinema. India has three of the world’s most populous cities—Mumbai, Kolkata, and Delhi—and rapidly growing high-technology centers like Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad.\n",
    "\n",
    "India’s geography includes the Himalayas, the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and the Deccan plateau. The Himalayas, the world's loftiest mountain system, form the northern boundary. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, stretching between the Himalayas and the Deccan, is a densely populated and agriculturally fertile area. The Deccan plateau, constituting the bulk of peninsular India, is geologically stable, with varying topography.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyderabad, a vibrant city in southern India, is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and rapid technological advancements. Nestled in the semi-arid region of Telangana, Hyderabad experiences a unique blend of climatic conditions that significantly influence its agriculture, economy, and daily life. The city's weather patterns, characterized by varying temperatures, humidity levels, and rainfall, play a crucial role in shaping its agricultural productivity and water resource management. With the increasing challenges posed by climate change, understanding and predicting these weather patterns have become more critical than ever."

    "## Research Statement\n",
    "The research aims to leverage deep learning techniques to develop a robust predictive model for weather conditions in Hyderabad. By incorporating both time series and geospatial data, the study will explore trends, patterns, and correlations among various weather parameters. The primary focus will be on predicting critical weather events, such as droughts and extreme temperatures, and understanding their impact on crop water requirements. This research will not only contribute to the scientific community's understanding of weather dynamics in the semi-arid tropics but also provide valuable insights for agricultural planning and water resource management in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The dataset for this research is provided by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), an esteemed international non-profit organization dedicated to scientific research for development. Established in 1972, ICRISAT is headquartered in Patancheru, Hyderabad, India, and operates several regional centers across Africa, including Bamako (Mali) and Nairobi (Kenya), as well as research stations in Niamey (Niger), Kano (Nigeria), Lilongwe (Malawi), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), and Bulawayo (Zimbabwe). India, the host country, has granted ICRISAT special status as a UN Organization, providing it with unique immunities and tax privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "ICRISAT has been collecting daily weather data in Hyderabad since 1978, resulting in a comprehensive dataset that spans over 40 years. This dataset includes crucial weather parameters such as maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity (morning and afternoon), wind speed, rainfall, bright sunshine hours, evaporation, radiation, and reference crop evapotranspiration (FAO56-ET). Additionally, it encompasses geospatial data, including longitude and latitude, enhancing the depth and scope of weather analysis."
